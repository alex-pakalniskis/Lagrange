My name is Alex Pakalniskis and I'm fascinated by all things machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'm based out of Los Angeles, California and have an academic background in geoinformatics and UAV remote sensing. Since February 2020, I've been a data science student at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/).
