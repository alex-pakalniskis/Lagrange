title: Welcome to Data Daze

My name is Alex Pakalniskis and I'm a data scientist based out of Los Angeles, California. I'm fascinated by machine learning and love to ride electric scooters and bikes. This is my blog where I'll highlight some of the cool projects I'm working on at Lambda School. In my freetime I enjoy cooking and playing guitar.
