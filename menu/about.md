Hi, my name is Alex and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. 

I have a background in [geoinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoinformatics), with an emphasis on [remote sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing) of vegetation. My MA [thesis research](https://search.proquest.com/openview/ffaee555994c5e1e6616aba6c65d4f0c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) explored the use of [UAVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle) to monitor invasive grass species in the Santa Monica Mountains. 

I'm passionate about tech outreach. Since 2018 I've volunteered with programs such as [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com) and [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

When I'm not on a computer, I enjoy gardening.
