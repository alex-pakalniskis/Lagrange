My name is Alex Pakalniskis and I'm fascinated by machine learning and parallel computing. I'm a Los Angeles native with an academic background in geoinformatics and UAV remote sensing (check out my [master's thesis](https://search.proquest.com/openview/ffaee555994c5e1e6616aba6c65d4f0c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) for more). Since February 2020, I've been a full-time data science student at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/). Follow my journey as I pivot to a career in tech.
