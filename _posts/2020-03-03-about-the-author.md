While working on repetitive analyses for my [master's thesis](https://search.proquest.com/openview/ffaee555994c5e1e6616aba6c65d4f0c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) I became interested in programming and open-source technologies. Although I've since given up flying drones (see my thesis), I've continued developing my technical chops. Since February 2020, I've been a data science student at Lambda School. Additionally, I'm preparing for the associate-level AWS Solutions Architect exam. On this blog I'll be posting projects and sharing some of the insights I gain in the process.
