While working on repetitive analyses for my master's thesis I became interested in programming and automation. Although I've since given up flying drones (see my thesis), I've continued developing my technical chops. Since February 2020, I've been a data science student at Lambda School (DS13->CS31). Additionally, I'm preparing for the associate-level AWS Solutions Architect exam. On this blog I'll be posting projects and sharing some of the insights I gain as I pivot to a career in tech.
