I'm thrilled to share that ["Dynamics of population growth in secondary cities across southern Africa"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-020-01086-6) has been accepted by Landscape Ecology. While working as a graduate research assistant at University of Arizona, I contributed JavaScript (Google Earth Engine) and Python code to analyze and visualize the relationships between different climate and corn production metrics across Zambia's administrative districts. I truly value the opportunity I had to dive in and use Google's cloud-based GIS. Likewise, collaborating with the co-authors was a wonderful experience.
